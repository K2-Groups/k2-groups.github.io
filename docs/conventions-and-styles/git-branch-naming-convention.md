# Git Branch Naming Convention

Having a convention for git branch names is important for several reasons:

1. **Consistency**: A naming convention ensures that all team members use the same format for branch names, making it easier to understand and navigate the repository. It promotes a consistent and standardized approach.
2. **Clarity**: Clear and descriptive branch names make it easier to identify the purpose or scope of a branch. This helps team members understand the intent of a branch and makes collaboration more efficient.
3. **Organization**: A well-defined naming convention allows for better organization of branches. It helps categorize branches based on their purpose, such as feature branches, bug fix branches, or release branches.
4. **Documentation**: Branch names can serve as documentation, providing insights into the history and evolution of the codebase. By following a naming convention, it becomes easier to track and understand the purpose of each branch.
5. **Automation**: Some development workflows and tools rely on branch names to automate processes. For example, continuous integration and deployment systems may trigger specific actions based on branch names. A consistent naming convention enables smoother automation workflows.

By establishing and following a proper naming convention, teams can improve collaboration, maintain a clean and organized codebase, and streamline their development processes.

## What is the Convention in K2?

In K2, the convention for git branch names follows the format: [project-name]/[type of the task]/[branch title], using "-" as a separator. For example, a branch for a feature related to the "oms-skeleton" project could be named `oms-skeleton/feature/init-project`. This convention helps provide clear and descriptive branch names, making it easier to identify the purpose or scope of each branch.
