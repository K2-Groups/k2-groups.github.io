15.1.	Unless permitted in the Guidelines and save as provided in this Clause 15, the Manager may not otherwise commit the Client to any borrowing.

15.2.	Subject to any restrictions in the Guidelines, the Client acknowledges and accepts that the Manager may undertake borrowing in respect of the Portfolio, including temporary overdrafts on the bank or cash accounts operated by the Client, for short-term liquidity management purposes, to settle a mismatched, delayed or failed transaction or for other unforeseen circumstances consistent with the efficient management of the Portfolio in accordance with the Guidelines.

15.3.	The Client shall be liable for all fees, costs and expenses which may arise out of any such properly incurred borrowing or overdrafts including any applicable interest charged provided that where an Affiliate of the Manager extends a loan to the Client in such circumstances it is expected that the rate of interest charged shall be at an arm’s length commercial rate.

17.2	Where the Client has entered into a securities lending programme with the Custodian or another third party, it shall procure that such Custodian or third party ensures that sufficient securities are available for the account of the Client to satisfy any settlement obligations created by such transactions entered into by the Manager for the Portfolio in accordance with the Guidelines as well as to comply with applicable law (including applicable requirements on short sales) in connection with such securities lending transactions.

17.3	Where the Manager has agreed to undertake stock lending, stock borrowing, repurchase or reverse repurchase arrangements in relation to assets in the Portfolio, these will be subject to the provisions of Schedule 6 in addition to any other agreement entered into pursuant to Clause 17.1.

The periodic statement shall include all information required by the AMF Rules to be provided in such statements, including a statement of the contents and the valuation of the Portfolio, on a periodic basis which shall be [quarterly or monthly] or such other frequency permitted by applicable regulation and agreed with the Client.[^13]

18.3.	The basis of all valuations will be as stated in the first periodic statement unless otherwise notified.

18.4.	Without prejudice to Clause 13.4, the Manager will maintain its own records of the Portfolio and transactions relating to the Portfolio to enable it to assess at any date, without undue delay, their nature and value. The Client acknowledges that valuation levels for the assets of the Portfolio in the periodic statements provided by the Manager in respect of the Portfolio shall reflect the Manager’s good faith effort to ascertain fair market levels (including accrued income, if any) for the assets reasonably believed by the Manager to be held for the Portfolio based on pricing and valuation information believed by the Manager to be reliable.

18.5.	The Manager may rely on an external data provider, Counterparty, Trade Repository or other third party to supply information or data of any kind, including derivative valuations. The Manager accepts no responsibility whatsoever (whether in contract, tort or otherwise, except to the extent that any such responsibility cannot be excluded by law) for Losses to the Client incurred as a consequence of the external data provider, Counterparty, Trade Repository or other third party supplying inaccurate information or data.

18.6.	The Client acknowledges that variations in market conditions will mean that the prices shown in periodic statements and any other reports do not necessarily reflect realisable values.

18.7.	The Manager will give the Client and its auditors all reasonable opportunity, during usual business hours of any Business Day on reasonable notice, to examine such part of the books and records (or an extract) of the Manager that relate directly to the Portfolio.

18.8.	Unless otherwise agreed, the Manager will not provide information about executed transactions on a transaction-by-transaction basis.

Unless the Client instructs the Manager to the contrary in writing, the Manager is authorised to issue proxy voting instructions or to vote on a show of hands at a meeting in relation to any relevant assets held or that were held in the Portfolio, and to execute and bind the Client in actions (including corporate actions), waivers, consents, covenants and indemnifications related to such voting proxies.

19.2.	The Client acknowledges and agrees that the Manager:

- a)	may establish guidelines for the exercise of voting of proxies or other rights and may employ the services of a proxy voting service to exercise proxies in accordance with the Manager’s guidelines;
- b)	may be precluded by regulation from exercising or procuring the exercise of any voting rights attaching to the Portfolio’s holdings of In-House Funds;
- c)	may, in its discretion, elect not to exercise or procure the exercise of any voting or other rights and, except as may be explicitly provided by applicable law, the Manager shall not incur any liability to the Client by reason of any exercise of, or failure to exercise, any such discretion and shall not incur any liability for any failure arising from an act or omission of a person other than the Manager; and
- d)	may not be able to audit the onward transmission of voting instructions from the Custodian or any proxy voting agent to any other party.

## 20.	Conflicts of interest
20.1.	The Manager and any Affiliate may effect transactions in which the Manager, any Affiliate, another client of the Manager or of an Affiliate has, directly or indirectly, a material interest or a relationship of any description with another party, which involves or may involve a potential conflict with the Manager’s duty to the Client. The Manager will ensure that such transactions are effected on terms which are not materially less favourable to the Client than if the conflict or potential conflict had not existed. Any conflicts which the Manager is not able to prevent or manage effectively shall be promptly disclosed by the Manager to the Client. Except as required by the AMF Rules, neither the Manager nor any Affiliate shall be liable to account to the Client for any profit, commission or remuneration made or received from or by reason of such transactions or any connected transactions or to disclose the same or the identity of any other client or counterparty involved in such transactions, nor will the Manager’s fees, unless otherwise provided, be abated.

20.2.	The Conflicts of Interest Policy sets out the types of actual or potential conflicts of interest which affect the Manager’s business and provides details of how these are identified, prevented or managed. A summary of the Conflicts of Interest Policy has been separately notified to the Client. Further details of the Conflicts of Interest Policy are available to the Client on request.

20.3.	The Manager will act as the agent of the Client and the Client will therefore be bound by the actions of the Manager taken on the Client’s behalf in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. Nevertheless, nothing in this Agreement, none of the services to be provided hereunder, nor any other matter shall:

- a)	oblige the Manager or any Affiliate to accept responsibilities more extensive than those set out in this Agreement; or
- b)	give rise to any fiduciary or equitable duties which would prevent or hinder the Manager or any Affiliate from either:
