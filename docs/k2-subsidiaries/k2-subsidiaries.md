# K2 Subsidiaries
K2 Group began its journey in 1389 (2010). The first division, which remains the heart of K2 to this day, was named K2 Core. Over the years, extensive focus has been placed on this core division, which serves as the fundamental trading algorithm of the capital market. This dedication and investment in K2 Core have allowed us to establish a firm foundation upon which we could expand and innovate.

The journey of K2 was not without challenges. We faced numerous obstacles, from navigating regulatory complexities to overcoming market volatility. Yet, each challenge presented us with an opportunity to grow stronger, to refine our strategies, and to better serve our purpose. The experience gained through overcoming these challenges has been instrumental in shaping the resilient, adaptive nature of K2 Group today. Our emphasis on adaptability and continuous learning has become a core value that defines who we are.

## Evolution into K2 Group
After years of growth and development, and with a unique structure based on transformative leadership principles, K2 evolved into K2 Group, built for a purpose beyond itself, named FamilyLink. The revenue generated by K2 is used not only to expand K2 itself but also to financially support FamilyLink, whose bold mission is to eliminate all orphanages around the world—a courageous commitment that we at K2 are determined to achieve. This ambitious goal requires relentless effort, unwavering dedication, and a vision that transcends boundaries.

FamilyLink represents our commitment to creating a world where every child has a loving home and a supportive community. The vision of eliminating orphanages globally is a testament to our belief that no child should grow up without the care and support they deserve. Through FamilyLink, we are working to build sustainable, community-driven solutions that empower families and provide children with the opportunity to thrive. The integration of FamilyLink into K2 Group is not just a corporate initiative; it is a personal mission that drives each of us to contribute towards a better future.

## A Focused Path Forward
We are still at the beginning of our journey, and this path is very long and costly. For this reason, we will focus on projects related to the capital market itself and refrain from pursuing side projects. Our decision to concentrate our efforts on core projects reflects our commitment to excellence and our desire to make a meaningful impact in the areas where we excel. By narrowing our focus, we can allocate our resources more effectively and ensure that we are making the greatest possible contribution to the capital market.

Additionally, I plan to gradually share more information about K2 and the journey it is taking right here. We believe in transparency and open communication, and we want our community to be a part of our journey. By sharing our progress, our challenges, and our successes, we hope to inspire others and invite them to join us in our mission to create a better future for all.
