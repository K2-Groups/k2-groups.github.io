- Investors acknowledge that by participating in the fund, **they accept all associated risks and waive any right to claim damages related to fund performance.**

> If you wish to participate, please review all the above terms carefully and ensure you understand your responsibilities and the nature of the investment.

## 8. Performance Calculation and Reporting

- Fund performance is calculated and published **at the end of each Gregorian calendar month** directly on our website.
- While we **do not offer guaranteed returns**, based on historical performance, the fund has **averaged at least 3% monthly profit** on invested capital.

### Profit Sharing Model

- If the fund makes a **monthly profit below 3%**, the **entire profit goes to the investor** and we do not take any share.
- If the monthly profit is **above 3%**, the total profit is split equally (50/50) between the investor and the fund. However, if the investor's share from this split is **less than 3%**, the fund will **give up part of its share** to ensure the investor still receives their 3% minimum.
- In case of a **loss**, the investor bears the loss entirely; **we do not share in the loss**.
- If a loss occurs, we will not take any profit in subsequent months **until the investor has recovered the loss and received a 3% return** for that period. Based on our long-term experience, such losses are rare and usually recovered over time.

#### Example (Scenario-Based)

Let’s assume you invest **1,000 USDT**.

**Scenario 1 – Fund earns 2% profit:**
At the end of the month, the fund generates 2% profit (20 USDT). Since this is below the 3% threshold, you receive the entire profit. The fund takes nothing.

- Investor's profit = 2% (20 USDT)
- Fund’s share = 0%

**Scenario 2 – Fund earns 5% profit:**
Total profit is 50 USDT. Normally this would be split equally (25 USDT each). But since 2.5% is below the 3% minimum, the fund gives 5 USDT from its share to top up your return to 3%.

- Investor's profit = 3% (30 USDT)
- Fund’s share = 2% (20 USDT)

**Scenario 3 – Fund earns 10% profit:**
Profit is 100 USDT. Split is 50/50. Your share (5%) already exceeds the 3% minimum, so no adjustment is needed.

- Investor's profit = 5% (50 USDT)
- Fund’s share = 5% (50 USDT)

**Scenario 4 – Fund incurs a -4% loss:**
You bear the full loss (40 USDT). In the following months, the fund will not take any profit until your loss is fully recovered and you receive your 3% profit.

- Fund’s share = 0% until investor recovery
- Investor recovery comes first

> This model ensures that **the investor always receives at least 3% profit (if the fund is profitable)** and benefits from any upside beyond that.
