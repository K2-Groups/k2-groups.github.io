# FamilyLink

At [FamilyLink](https://okbayat.com/family-link), we believe that the root of many social problems, including the emergence of orphans, lies in **poverty combined with illness, lack of access to quality education, family tensions, natural disasters, addiction, unemployment, divorce, and disability**. Therefore, one of the approaches we strongly believe in is creating a powerful **conversational domain**, enabling families to become self-sufficient and generate sustainable wealth. This wealth is not only financial but also cultural, social, and psychological. By creating such an environment, we can prevent the emergence of orphans in society, empowering families to independently and confidently face challenges and threats, thus ensuring a stable and nurturing environment for their children.

The primary goal of the **K2 Group** is to establish this environment by generating wealth and suitable job opportunities for the [FamilyLink](https://okbayat.com/family-link) project. We believe that alongside pushing the boundaries of knowledge, serving all humanity, and creating wealth for all our stakeholders and customers, we can build a safe home for every child, paving the way toward a better future for humanity. **We have chosen our love to encompass all humanityâ€”something deeply inherent in every one of us.**
