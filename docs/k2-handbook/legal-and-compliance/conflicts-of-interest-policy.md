# Conflicts of Interest Policy
The Conflicts of Interest Policy outlines the expectations and responsibilities for K2 Group members—particularly those in financial and decision-making roles—to proactively identify, disclose, and manage any potential conflicts. Members must regularly review this policy, maintain awareness, and ensure their actions consistently uphold K2’s standards of transparency, integrity, and accountability.
