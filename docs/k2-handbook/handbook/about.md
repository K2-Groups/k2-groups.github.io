# About the Handbook

## History

The idea of creating the K2 Handbook emerged from our realization that **greater transparency and faster alignment** are essential for achieving better performance and accelerating our goals.

As K2 evolved, we often found ourselves encountering similar questions from team members, collaborators, or external partners. These questions—had they been clearly and publicly documented—could have been resolved much more quickly.

Following the [GitLab Handbook](https://handbook.gitlab.com), we decided to build a comprehensive, searchable reference for everything related to K2. This handbook is not just for internal team members but also for anyone who wants to understand our structure, values, processes, and projects.

Our goal is to foster a culture of **transparency, documentation, and open access to organizational knowledge**—a culture that helps us grow into an agile, learning-oriented, and trustworthy organization.
