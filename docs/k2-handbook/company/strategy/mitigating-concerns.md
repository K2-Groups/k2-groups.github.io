# Mitigating Concerns
At K2, we acknowledge that any ambitious vision comes with its own set of challenges. To stay honest, agile, and effective in pursuing our goals, we actively identify and document potential risks, uncertainties, and concerns that may arise along the way.

The **Mitigating Concerns** page exists to ensure transparency, strategic foresight, and collective preparedness. Here, we outline the obstacles that may hinder our progress and the steps we're taking—or planning to take—to address them.

By publicly recognizing these concerns, we create a culture of proactive problem-solving and resilient execution that aligns with K2’s long-term mission.

This page is an evolving document and will be updated continuously as new challenges emerge or existing ones are resolved.
