# K2 Group Vision
{ Behind the Scenes of Our Innovative Approach | fs-6 }

## Vision
Our vision lays out a clear path to transform the educational and practical experiences of university professors, students, and school-aged learners over the next 25 years.

This comprehensive vision is transparently shared with all K2 Group members through our internal handbook.

This document provides insight into K2 Group’s long-term strategic planning process.

### Strategic Cadence
Our strategic vision is based on a 25-year timeline, structured around 10-year mid-term goals and 3-year operational strategies.

### Long-Term Goal (2050)
By 2050, our goal is to fundamentally transform the structure of education—both in schools and universities—worldwide. In this model, students engage in real-world projects from their first day of school and continue working on them throughout their educational journey. This approach shifts learning from purely theoretical and epistemological toward experiential and phenomenological. We believe this path nurtures authentic individual growth and, ultimately, enables us to push the boundaries of knowledge.

### Mid-Term School-Level Goals
We believe that in order to truly reshape the boundaries of knowledge, transformation must begin at the school level. From now through 2050, our focus is on building an environment where students engage in real-world projects from the very start of their academic journey.

- **By 2030:** 1 million students will be part of this new, project-based educational structure.
- **By 2040:** That number will grow to 50 million students.
- **By 2050:** Over 100 million students around the world will benefit from this educational model.

### Mid-Term University-Level Goals
- **By 2030:** Universities across Iran will adopt our approach, engaging students in K2-defined real-world projects throughout their academic programs.
- **By 2040:** We will partner with top global universities, expanding our approach internationally and significantly influencing higher education worldwide.
- **By 2050:** University structures will be fully redesigned so that all students participate in real-world projects from the outset of their academic experience. Higher education will become a true environment for the creation and development of applied knowledge.

### Advancing the Frontiers of Knowledge
As stated in our mission, we firmly believe that shifting the boundaries of knowledge can only happen by starting with reform in both school and university education. Through our pioneering model that immerses students in real-world project work, we continuously expand the frontiers of knowledge and empower the next generation of researchers and professionals with meaningful, practical skills.

### Exploring Opportunities for Collaboration
We actively seek opportunities to bridge academia and industry, fostering synergistic partnerships that benefit universities, students, and society at large.

### Addressing Challenges
We proactively identify potential obstacles to realizing our educational vision and document solutions on our dedicated Mitigating Concerns page.
