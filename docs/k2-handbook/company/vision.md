# K2 Group Vision
{ Behind the Scenes of Our Innovative Approach | fs-6 }

## Vision
Our vision lays out a clear path to transform the educational and practical experiences of university professors, students, and school-aged learners over the next 25 years.

This comprehensive vision is transparently shared with all K2 Group members through our internal handbook.

This document provides insight into K2 Group’s long-term strategic planning process.

### Long-Term Goal
Our vision for the next 25 years (by 2050) is to become the world's largest asset management company, managing assets exceeding \$15 trillion.

### Mid-Term Goals
To achieve this ambitious vision, we have set the following mid-term goals:

- **By 2040:** We will establish over 150 valuable and impactful asset management startups operating in influential, advanced countries such as the USA, Canada, China, Japan, Germany, and Iran.
- **By 2030:** We will create a robust platform to foster growth and development, establishing over 20 successful startups within our ecosystem.
- **By 2050:** We will become the world's largest asset management company, managing assets exceeding \$15 trillion.

In alignment with our mission to create an environment encouraging bold responsibility for humanity, we will establish close partnerships and collaboration with universities, professors, and students. Our university-level objectives are as follows:

- **By 2030:** Universities across Iran will adopt our approach, engaging students in K2-defined real-world projects throughout their academic programs.
- **By 2040:** We will partner with top global universities, expanding our innovative educational approach internationally and significantly influencing higher education worldwide.
- **By 2050:** University structures will be entirely redesigned so that all students engage in real-world projects from the very start of their academic experience. Higher education will evolve into a true environment for the creation and development of applied knowledge.
