# The Teddy Stoddard Story
There’s a story from many years ago that tells of an elementary school teacher whose name was Mrs. Thompson. As she stood in front of her fifth-grade class on the first day of school, she told her children a lie. Like most teachers, she looked at her students and told them that she loved them all the same. But that simply was not true, because there, in the front row, slumped in his seat, was a little boy named Teddy Stoddard.

Mrs. Thompson had watched Teddy the year before and noticed that he didn’t play well with the other children. His clothes were messy and he constantly needed a bath. Teddy could be unpleasant at times. It got to the point where Mrs. Thompson would take delight in marking his papers with a broad red pen and making bold X’s and finally putting a Big “F” on the top of his papers.

At the school where Mrs. Thompson taught she was required to review each child’s past records. She put Teddy’s off till last. When she finally reviewed his file, she was in for a surprise.

Teddys first grade teacher wrote, “Teddy is a bright child with a ready laugh. He does his work neatly and has good manners. He’s a joy to be around.”

His second-grade teacher wrote, “Teddy is an excellent student and well-liked by his classmates. But he’s troubled because his mother has a terminal illness and life at home must be a struggle.”

His third-grade teacher wrote, “His mother’s death has been hard on him. He tries to do his best, but his father doesn’t show much interest. His home life will soon affect him if steps aren’t taken.”

Teddy’s fourth-grade teacher wrote, “Teddy is withdrawn and doesn’t show much interest in school. He doesn’t have many friends and sometimes he even sleeps in class.”

By now, Mrs. Thompson realized the problem and she was ashamed of herself. She felt even worse when her students brought her Christmas presents wrapped in beautiful ribbons and bright paper, except for Teddys. His present was clumsily wrapped in heavy brown paper that he got from a grocery bag. Mrs. Thompson took pains to open it in the middle of the other presents. Some of the children started to laugh when she found a rhinestone bracelet with some of the stones missing and a bottle that was one-quarter full of perfume. But she stifled the children’s laughter when she explained how pretty the bracelet was while putting it on and then dabbing some of the perfume on her wrist.

Teddy Stoddard stayed after school that day just long enough to say, “Mrs. Thompson, today you smell just like my mom used to.”

After the children left she cried for at least an hour. On this very day, she quit teaching reading, writing and arithmetic and instead she began to teach children. Mrs. Thompson began to pay close attention to Teddy as she worked with him. As time went on his mind seemed to come alive. The more she encouraged him, the faster he responded. By the end of the year, Teddy had become one of the smartest children in the class.

Despite her lie, he had become one of her teacher’s pets. A year later she found a note under the door from Teddy telling her that she was the best teacher he had ever had in his whole life.

Six years passed by and to her surprise, another note came from Teddy. He wrote that he had finished high school third in his class and that she was still the best teacher that he had ever had in his whole life. Four years later, another letter came, saying that while things had been tough at times, he stayed in school and stuck with it and that he had graduated from college with the highest of honors. He assured Mrs. Thompson that she was still the very best and favorite teacher he had ever had in his whole life.

Four more years passed by and yet another letter came. This time he explained that after he got his bachelor’s degree, he had decided to go a little further. Again, assuring her that she was still
the best and favorite teacher he ever had. The letter was signed Theodore F. Stoddard MD.

The story doesn’t end there. There was one final letter that spring. Teddy said that he had met this girl and that he was going to be married. He explained that his father had died a couple years ago and he was wondering if Mrs. Thompson might agree to sit in the place, at his wedding, that was usually reserved for the mother of the groom. Of course, Mrs. Thompson did. She wore that bracelet, the one with the several rhinestones missing. She also made sure she was wearing the perfume that Teddy remembered his mother wearing on their last Christmas together.

After the wedding, they hugged each other as Dr. Teddy Stoddard whispered in Mrs. Thompson ear, “Thank you so much for making me feel important and showing me that I could make a difference.”

Mrs. Thompson, with tears in her eyes, whispered back, “Teddy you have it all wrong. You were the one who taught me that I could make a difference. I didn’t know how to teach until I met you.”

## The power of new possibilities
The story of Mrs. Thompson and Teddy Stoddard illustrates the power of new possibilities, opening oneself to change, and the transformative impact it can have on both individuals and their relationships. At the beginning of the story, Mrs. Thompson, like many others, operated within the fixed pattern of teaching, marking Teddy's papers with red X's and labeling them with a failing grade. However, when she delved deeper into Teddy's background, she discovered a different perspective.

By opening herself to new possibilities, Mrs. Thompson realized that Teddy's troubled behavior was a result of his difficult home life, rather than a reflection of his true potential. This shift in perception allowed her to see beyond the surface and recognize the challenges Teddy faced. Instead of giving up on him, she chose to engage with him on a more personal level, demonstrating care and compassion.

Through her genuine interest and support, Mrs. Thompson created an environment that nurtured Teddy's growth. She recognized the importance of acknowledging his unique circumstances and providing the encouragement he needed to excel. As a result, Teddy's mind came alive, and he blossomed academically, becoming one of the smartest students in the class.

The story showcases the power of opening oneself to change and clearing away preconceived notions. Mrs. Thompson's willingness to reevaluate her approach to teaching and connect with Teddy on a deeper level transformed both their lives. It demonstrates that by embracing new possibilities and adopting a more open and compassionate mindset, we can make a positive difference in the lives of others.

In our own lives and relationships, we can apply this lesson by recognizing that everyone has their own unique circumstances, challenges, and potential. By approaching others with openness, empathy, and a willingness to understand their perspectives, we create a space for growth and transformation. Rather than being confined to fixed patterns and judgments, we can choose to engage in genuine connections that foster understanding, support, and personal development.

The story of Mrs. Thompson and Teddy Stoddard reminds us of the profound impact we can have when we look at others from a new possibility, opening, and clearing perspective. It teaches us that by embracing change, challenging our assumptions, and fostering genuine connections, we can make a lasting and positive impact on the lives of those around us.
