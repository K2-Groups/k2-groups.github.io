# Technologies
{: .no_toc }

Technologies that must be chosen for any project are currently divided into five categories:

1. Database
2. Programming language
3. Programming framework (can be determined and implemented by the project team)
4. Programming paradigm (e.g. using reactive programming paradigm)
5. Architecture used in the project

The recommended default choices by the **K2** team for each project are as follows:

1. MongoDB
2. Kotlin
3. Spring Boot (version 3 or above)
4. Reactive Programming (With ProjectReactor)
5. Domain-driven design for the business logic part and the clean architecture for the whole project

## Balancing Priorities!

At **K2**, we believe in approaching technology as a valuable tool in our arsenal. Our priority is to thoroughly comprehend the problem at hand and then seek out an appropriate solution. From there, **we determine which tools in our arsenal are best suited to effectively address the problem**. It is crucial that **technology does not veer us away from our path of problem-solving**. Nonetheless, there will **always be a trade-off** when it comes to the various technologies at our disposal, and we continuously strive to optimize their utilization in our work.

## Introducing new technology

Here at **K2**, we are constantly exploring the use of new technologies. If you are beginning a project and feel that our suggested toolbox might not have the required capabilities to address your problem, we encourage you to open an issue on our team's GitHub repository. Please provide your suggestions and the rationale behind your selection, and assign the issue to me(@mahdibohloul). I would be delighted to help you discover the most suitable tool for your requirements.
