# K2 Handbook
This is the official handbook to find everything you need to know to work in K2 Group.

## Table of Content
* [Shapes](./shapes/)
* [Onborading Guide](./on-boarding/)

> Note: Please add the link of any new section to the above list.

## How this document is maintained
This document is inspired by [Gitlab Handbook](git@github.com:K2-Groups/k2-handbook.git) and is the result of iterative changes. Our goal is to write everything a person needs to get onboard and contribute in K2 Group. The policy is that everyone facing a new issue or question that is not yet written in the handbook must write a related page in this handbook to make it closer and closer to complete.  
Enjoy :)
